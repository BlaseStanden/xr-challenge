Comments on the challenge:

I really enjoyed this challenge and I felt it was a great opportunity to show off my knowledge with Unity. I believe if I had more time I would have continued to flesh out the game and improve the player experience.

Upon reflection of the challenge, one area that I could improve on in the future includes the more comprehensive use of Git as 
I believe that I could have pushed my changes more often to prevent backtracking to an earlier version of the project, resulting in loss of progress. 
I would also like to make my code more efficient and transferable as some, although only a few, 
were coded in a way that requires me to chance the properties in the script rather than the inspector. 

I felt this project went really well and it was great to be using Unity every day again. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it!
